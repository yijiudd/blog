## The whole process

The initial reason why I want to find an internship is that I felt kind of unconfident about finding jobs in Japan. 
<br/>
<br/>
First I had a long time not coding every day in front-end development, I thought maybe I would forget some of my skills, and then I thought my Japanese was not as good as other foreign students. Unless I am very professional in my area, I could get a satisfactory job.  Finally, I think I want to learn something real that how big company build their AI products.So I started to try.
<br/>
<br/>
 Basically, why I quit my previous job and chose to continue my master's study in Waseda because I want to learn AI as much as I can. So finding a software Engineer intern in the AI industry is the best idea.
<br/>
<br/>
Let us jump directly into the interview part, The initial thought I had was that maybe Sony's interview was not as hard as Bytedance, cause I had experience with Bytedance's interviewer. To be honest, the interview in Bytedance was really hard. There were 3 rounds of interviews. The first 2 rounds are all about coding in front of the screen. It is easy to fail because maybe you will meet some coding questions you are not familiar with and spend a long time.
<br/>
<br/>
How about Sony? It surprised me that It also had a coding test in front of the screen in the first round. Cause I had a long time no coding using Javascript and learning PyTorch at that time, in the interview, I mixed the API of Array in javascript and Python, so I was very nervous when I wrote code. Spending lots of time finding the error. But fortunately, I passed the code test.
<br/>
<br/>
After the interview, I thought indeed I had forgotten lots of my skills and I needed to strengthen them. And I am happy too cause I think my English is good cause it was an English interview.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, thanks to the Sony AI team's trust I will do my best in the following internship.ðŸ˜‚
