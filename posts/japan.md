## Diary 


I came to Tokyo on September 11th. It has been about a week since I came here. The first two days were hard for me because there was no furniture in the rented house, so I had to lie on the ground with a quilt. Even worse was that I could barely understand Japanese, so it would be a little difficult to do some daily things, like eating outside or buying something.
<br/>
<br/>
So the next few days I started to buy necessary furniture, lights, and cooking supplies. I went to Ikebukuro, a very lively place, with lots of stores. I went to Bic Camera to set up a Japanese phone number and, Nitori to buy curtains and pillows. Those days when I came back to the house, I was so tired that I fell asleep as soon as I lay down.
<br/>
<br/>
And from the day before yesterday, I started to learn Japanese, totally from scratch. I studied some words in China for a few months, but I could not understand what people saying. That was too fast.
So I went to a library in Nerima City, that offered free Japanese lessons for foreigners. I think my other goal is to learn to speak Japanese fluently. 
<br/>
<br/>
After eating outside for about 5 days, I start to cook myself. I tried noodles and chicken beef rice in the restaurant around my place. And then I cooked them for myself, I watched YouTube to learn how to cook 牛丼, and I bought Japanese seasons from stores. The taste of my meal was almost similar to what I ate in the outside restaurant.
<br/>
<br/>
So life gets better and better for me. I still have many other things to do in the future. I hope I can learn Japanese quickly and get used to life in Tokyo.
<br/>

Tonight's 12 o'clock is my birthday, I hope I can have a good time in Japan.
