## The Whole Story


My work experience in [<u>*Bytedance*</u>](https://www.bytedance.com/en/) started in *2020.9*, the time when I was in the 4th year of my college. 
I started as an intern and I worked with other engineers developing Html mini-games. We use a game engine called [<u>*Cocos*</u>](https://www.cocos.com/en).
At that time I felt that I grew quickly both in coding proficiency and understanding. I worked hard and almost left the company at 10 pm every day.
<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, I got the return offer in *2021.3*. Because I felt too tired during this period of internship, I decided to go back to school to relax for 3 months. After I graduated, I would start my regular engineering career.
<br/>
<br/>
So I started as a front-end engineer at *2021.7* after I graduated from [<u>*BUPT*</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_University_of_Posts_and_Telecommunications). Most of the development projects I participate in were for Apps under Bytedance, such as JueJin, and Douyin. Still making H5 games, but I started to be exposed to front-end development. Not only used game engines but also used the framework(React) to write some UI. The feeling that I learned more about knowledge and skills for development was really good.
<br/>
<br/>
My disappointment came from some small but urgent development projects, they are very time-limited(1 week) and lack of design. So I had to work overtime as there were many changes in the requirements of the design. I spent lots of time but could not feel a sense of accomplishment anymore. 
<br/>
<br/>
The fuse of my resignation is one project that I worked overtime every weekend which lasted for 2 months. During that time, I was very tired and depressed. Even doing nothing on the laptop, I did not want to stay at my desk. After careful but suffering consideration for about 2 months, I thought I had to tell my leader that I would quit. Then I quit Bytedance in 2022.11.
<br/>
<br/>
Coincidentally, the decision to go to Japan for the Master's study was also made during that timeðŸ˜„
